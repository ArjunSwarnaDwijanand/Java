what is design pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. Design patterns are best practices for object-oriented programming. They can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

What are the types of design patterns?


There are three types of design patterns:

1. Creational Design Patterns: These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

2. Structural Design Patterns: These design patterns are all about class and object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

3. Behavioral Design Patterns: These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. These patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects, or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.

What are the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns?

The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are a collection of 23 design patterns that were developed by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". The Gang of Four design patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

What are the advantages of design patterns?

The advantages of design patterns are:

1. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
2. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
3. Design patterns can improve the communication among designers and developers.
4. Design patterns can make the design more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.
5. Design patterns can provide a common vocabulary for developers to use when discussing the design.

What are the disadvantages of design patterns?

The disadvantages of design patterns are:

1. Design patterns can be overused, making the code more complex and harder to read.
2. Design patterns can be misused, leading to unnecessary complexity in the design.
3. Design patterns can be difficult to learn and understand, especially for novice developers.

What is the Singleton design pattern?

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The Singleton design pattern is used when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to one object.

example of Singleton design pattern?

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

explain above code?

In the above code, the Singleton class has a private static instance variable that holds the single instance of the class. The constructor of the Singleton class is private to prevent the instantiation of the class from outside the class. The getInstance() method is a static method that returns the single instance of the class. The getInstance() method checks if the instance is null and creates a new instance if it is null.


handle the Singleton design pattern in a multithreaded environment?

To handle the Singleton design pattern in a multithreaded environment, you can use the double-checked locking approach. In this approach, you check if the instance is null before acquiring the lock and then check again after acquiring the lock to ensure that only one instance is created.

example of Singleton design pattern in a multithreaded environment?

public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

explain above code?

In the above code, the Singleton class has a private static volatile instance variable that holds the single instance of the class. The constructor of the Singleton class is private to prevent the instantiation of the class from outside the class. The getInstance() method is a static method that returns the single instance of the class. The getInstance() method checks if the instance is null and creates a new instance if it is null. The synchronized block ensures that only one thread can create the instance at a time.

What is the Factory design pattern?

The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The Factory design pattern is used when you want to create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to the newly created object using a common interface.

example of Factory design pattern?

public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

        Shape circle = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        circle.draw();

        Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
        rectangle.draw();
    }
}

explain above code?

In the above code, the Shape interface defines the draw() method. The Circle and Rectangle classes implement the Shape interface and provide their own implementation of the draw() method. The ShapeFactory class provides a getShape() method that returns a Shape object based on the shapeType parameter. The Main class creates a ShapeFactory object and uses it to create Circle and Rectangle objects.

What is the Abstract Factory design pattern?

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Abstract Factory design pattern is used when you want to create a family of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

example of Abstract Factory design pattern?

public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public interface Color {
    void fill();
}

public class Red implements Color {
    @Override
    public void fill() {
        System.out.println("Filling with red color");
    }
}

public class Blue implements Color {
    @Override
    public void fill() {
        System.out.println("Filling with blue color");
    }
}

public abstract class AbstractFactory {
    public abstract Shape getShape(String shapeType);
    public abstract Color getColor(String colorType);

        if (shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Color getColor(String colorType) {
        return null;
    }
}

public class ColorFactory extends AbstractFactory {
    @Override
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Color getColor(String colorType) {
        if (colorType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (colorType.equalsIgnoreCase("RED")) {
            return new Red();
        } else if (colorType.equalsIgnoreCase("BLUE")) {
            return new Blue();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

public class FactoryProducer {
    public static AbstractFactory getFactory(String factoryType) {
        if (factoryType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (factoryType.equalsIgnoreCase("SHAPE")) {
            return new ShapeFactory();
        } else if (factoryType.equalsIgnoreCase("COLOR")) {
            return new ColorFactory();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractFactory shapeFactory = FactoryProducer.getFactory("SHAPE");

        Shape circle = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        circle.draw();

        Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
        rectangle.draw();

        AbstractFactory colorFactory = FactoryProducer.getFactory("COLOR");

        Color red = colorFactory.getColor("RED");
        red.fill();

        Color blue = colorFactory.getColor("BLUE");
        blue.fill();
    }
}

explain above code?

In the above code, the Shape interface defines the draw() method, and the Circle and Rectangle classes implement the Shape interface. The Color interface defines the fill() method, and the Red and Blue classes implement the Color interface. The AbstractFactory class provides abstract methods for creating Shape and Color objects. The ShapeFactory and ColorFactory classes extend the AbstractFactory class and provide

What is the Builder design pattern?

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. The Builder design pattern is used when you want to construct a complex object step by step and the construction process should be independent of the parts that make up the object.

example of Builder design pattern?

public class Computer {
    private String cpu;
    private String ram;
    private String storage;

    public Computer(ComputerBuilder builder) {
        this.cpu = builder.cpu;
        this.ram = builder.ram;
        this.storage = builder.storage;
    }

    public String getCpu() {
        return cpu;
    }

    public String getRam() {
        return ram;
    }

    public String getStorage() {
        return storage;
    }

    public static class ComputerBuilder {
        private String cpu;
        private String ram;
        private String storage;

        public ComputerBuilder setCpu(String cpu) {
            this.cpu = cpu;
            return this;
        }

        public ComputerBuilder setRam(String ram) {
            this.ram = ram;
            return this;
        }

        public ComputerBuilder setStorage(String storage) {
            this.storage = storage;
            return this;
        }

        public Computer build() {
            return new Computer(this);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer computer = new Computer.ComputerBuilder()
                .setCpu("Intel Core i7")
                .setRam("16GB")
                .setStorage("1TB SSD")
                .build();

        System.out.println("CPU: " + computer.getCpu());
        System.out.println("RAM: " + computer.getRam());
        System.out.println("Storage: " + computer.getStorage());
    }
}

explain above code?

In the above code, the Computer class has three private fields: cpu, ram, and storage. The Computer class has a private constructor that takes a ComputerBuilder object as a parameter. The ComputerBuilder class has three setter methods to set the cpu, ram, and storage fields. The ComputerBuilder class has a build() method that creates a new Computer object with the values set by the setter methods.

What is the Prototype design pattern?

The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create a new object by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. The Prototype design pattern is used when you want to create a new object by copying an existing object and the creation process is expensive.

What is the Adapter design pattern?

The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. The Adapter design pattern is used when you want to make two incompatible interfaces compatible and the client expects a single interface.

What is the Bridge design pattern?

The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. The Bridge design pattern is used when you want to separate the abstraction from its implementation and the abstraction and implementation should be extensible by subclassing.

What is the Composite design pattern?

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The Composite design pattern is used when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects and the individual objects and compositions of objects should be treated uniformly.

What is the Decorator design pattern?

The Decorator design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an object dynamically without changing its structure. The Decorator design pattern is used when you want to add new functionality to an object without changing its structure and the new functionality should be added at runtime.

What is the Facade design pattern?

The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade design pattern is used when you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem and the interfaces of a subsystem are complex or difficult to understand.

What is the Flyweight design pattern?

What is the Proxy design pattern?

The Proxy design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The Proxy design pattern is used when you want to control access to an object and the object is expensive to create or access.

What is the Chain of Responsibility design pattern?

The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass a request along a chain of handlers. The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is used when you want to decouple the sender and receiver of a request and more than one object may handle the request.

What is the Command design pattern?

The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. The Command design pattern is used when you want to parameterize objects with requests and the request should be queued, logged, and support undoable operations.

What is the Interpreter design pattern?

The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. The Interpreter design pattern is used when you want to interpret a language grammar or expressions and the grammar is simple.

What is the Iterator design pattern?

The Mediator design pattern is used when you want to communicate between multiple objects and the communication logic is complex.

What is the Memento design pattern?

The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to capture and restore an object's internal state. The Memento design pattern is used when you want to capture an object's internal state and restore it later and the object should be restored to its previous state.

What is the Observer design pattern?

The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. The Observer design pattern is used when you want to define a one-to-many dependency between objects and the object should notify its dependents when its state changes.

What is the State design pattern?

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to change the behavior of an object when its internal state changes. The State design pattern is used when you want to change the behavior of an object when its internal state changes and the object should appear to change its class.
