    What is the difference between daemon and user threads?

    The difference between daemon and user threads is given below:

    Daemon Thread
    User Thread
    1. Daemon thread is a low priority thread.
    1. User thread is a high priority thread.
    2. Daemon thread is used to provide services to user threads.
    2. User thread is used to perform the task.
    3. Daemon thread is a service provider thread.
    3. User thread is a task provider thread.
    4. Daemon thread is used to perform background tasks.
    4. User thread is used to perform the task.

    example of daemon thread:

}

 What do you understand by inter-thread communication?

    Inter-thread communication is a mechanism in which one thread can communicate with another thread. It is used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads. It allows threads to synchronize their actions and exchange information.

    What is the purpose of the wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods?

    The purpose of the wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods is to provide a mechanism for inter-thread communication in Java.

    wait(): The wait() method is used to pause the execution of the current thread until another thread notifies the calling thread.
    notify(): The notify() method is used to wake up a single thread that is waiting on the object.
    notifyAll(): The notifyAll() method is used to wake up all the threads that are waiting on the object.

    example of wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods:

    class WaitNotifyExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Object lock = new Object();
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }

        static class Task implements Runnable {
            private Object lock;

            public Task(Object lock) {
                this.lock = lock;
            }

            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting.");
                    try {
                        lock.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is notified.");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    What is deadlock in Java?

    Deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are waiting for each other to release the resources they need to proceed. As a result, the threads are stuck in a state of waiting indefinitely, and the program becomes unresponsive.

    example of deadlock:

    class DeadlockExample {
        private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
        private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task1());
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task2());
            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }

        static class Task1 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock1.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task1 waiting for lock2.");
                    synchronized (lock2) {
                        System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock2.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        static class Task2 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock2.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task2 waiting for lock1.");
                    synchronized (lock1) {
                        System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock1.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    locking mechanism in deadlock:

    class DeadlockExample {
        private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
        private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task1());
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task2());
            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }

        static class Task1 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock1.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task1 waiting for lock2.");
                    synchronized (lock2) {
                        System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock2.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        static class Task2 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock2.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task2 waiting for lock1.");
                    synchronized (lock1) {
                        System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock1.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }



    How can you prevent deadlock in Java?

    Deadlock can be prevented in Java by following some best practices:

    Avoid nested locks: Try to acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent circular dependencies.
    Use a timeout: Use a timeout mechanism to prevent threads from waiting indefinitely.
    Use a single lock: Use a single lock to synchronize access to shared resources.
    Use higher-level concurrency constructs: Use higher-level concurrency constructs like ExecutorService and CompletableFuture to manage threads and tasks.

    example of preventing deadlock:

    class DeadlockPreventionExample {
        private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
        private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task1());
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task2());
            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }

        static class Task1 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock1.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task1 waiting for lock2.");
                    synchronized (lock2) {
                        System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock2.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        static class Task2 implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock1.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    System.out.println("Task2 waiting for lock2.");
                    synchronized (lock2) {
                        System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock2.");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    What is the purpose of the Executor framework in Java?

    The Executor framework in Java is used to manage and execute tasks asynchronously. It provides a higher-level abstraction for managing threads and tasks, making it easier to create and manage concurrent applications.

    What are the advantages of using the Executor framework in Java?

    The advantages of using the Executor framework in Java are:

    Simplified thread management: The Executor framework provides a higher-level abstraction for managing threads and tasks, making it easier to create and manage concurrent applications.
    Improved performance: The Executor framework can improve the performance of the application by efficiently managing threads and tasks.
    Resource management: The Executor framework helps in managing system resources efficiently by controlling the number of threads and tasks.
    Task scheduling: The Executor framework provides flexible task scheduling options, allowing tasks to be executed at specific times or intervals.

    What is the difference between Executor and ExecutorService in Java?

    The difference between Executor and ExecutorService in Java is given below:

    Executor
    ExecutorService

    Executor is an interface in Java that provides a simple way to execute tasks asynchronously.
    ExecutorService is a subinterface of Executor that provides additional methods for managing and controlling the execution of tasks.
    Executor does not provide methods for managing the lifecycle of the executor or controlling the execution of tasks.
    ExecutorService provides methods for managing the lifecycle of the executor, controlling the execution of tasks, and shutting down the executor.
    Executor is a simple interface that provides a basic way to execute tasks asynchronously.
    ExecutorService is a more advanced interface that provides additional methods for managing and controlling the execution of tasks.

    What is the purpose of the Callable interface in Java?

    The Callable interface in Java is used to define a task that can be executed asynchronously and return a result. It is similar to the Runnable interface, but it can return a result or throw an exception.

    What is the difference between the Runnable and Callable interface in Java?

    The difference between the Runnable and Callable interface in Java is given below:

    Runnable
    Callable

    Runnable is a functional interface in Java that defines a task that can be executed asynchronously.
    Callable is a functional interface in Java that defines a task that can be executed asynchronously and return a result.

    Runnable does not return a result or throw an exception.
    Callable can return a result or throw an exception.

    Runnable is a simple interface that defines a task that can be executed asynchronously.
    Callable is a more advanced interface that defines a task that can be executed asynchronously and return a result.

    example of Runnable interface:

    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Runnable task is running.");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
            Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
            thread.start();
        }
    }

    example of Callable interface:

    class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
        @Override
        public String call() throws Exception {
            return "Callable task is running.";
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
            MyCallable myCallable = new MyCallable();
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            Future<String> future = executor.submit(myCallable);
            System.out.println(future.get());
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }

 Why must wait() method be called from the synchronized block?

The wait() method must be called from a synchronized block because it releases the lock on the object it is called on. If the wait() method is not called from a synchronized block, it will throw an IllegalMonitorStateException.

example of wait() method called from a synchronized block:

class WaitExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object lock = new Object();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private Object lock;

        public Task(Object lock) {
            this.lock = lock;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting.");
                try {
                    lock.wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is notified.");
            }
        }
    }
}

example of wait() method called without a synchronized block:

class WaitExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object lock = new Object();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(lock));
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private Object lock;

        public Task(Object lock) {
            this.lock = lock;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting.");
            try {
                lock.wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is notified.");
        }
    }
}

Is it possible to start a thread twice?

No, it is not possible to start a thread twice in Java. Once a thread has been started, it cannot be started again. If you try to start a thread that has already been started, it will throw an IllegalThreadStateException.

example of starting a thread twice:

class StartTwiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
        thread.start();
        thread.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running.");
        }
    }
}

Can we call the run() method instead of start()?

Yes, we can call the run() method instead of the start() method, but it will not create a new thread. It will simply execute the run() method in the current thread.

example of calling the run() method instead of start():

class RunExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
        thread.run();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running.");
        }
    }
}

Can we make the user thread as daemon thread if the thread is started?

No, once a thread is started, we cannot change its daemon status. If a thread is started as a user thread, it will remain a user thread until it completes its execution.

example of making a user thread as a daemon thread:

class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
        thread.start();
        thread.setDaemon(true);
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Thread is running.");
            }
        }
    }
}

What is shutdown hook?

A shutdown hook is a thread that is registered with the JVM to perform cleanup tasks before the JVM shuts down. It is executed when the JVM is about to exit, either normally or due to an external event like a user interrupt or a system shutdown.

example of shutdown hook:

public class ShutdownHookExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Shutdown hook is running.");
        }));
        System.out.println("Main thread is running.");
    }
}

When should we interrupt a thread?

We should interrupt a thread when we want to stop its execution or notify it to stop. The interrupt() method is used to interrupt a thread. It sets the interrupt status of the thread, which can be checked using the isInterrupted() method.

example of interrupting a thread:

class InterruptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
        thread.start();
        thread.interrupt();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                System.out.println("Thread is running.");
            }
            System.out.println("Thread is interrupted.");
        }
    }
}

Can Java object be locked down for exclusive use by a given thread?

Yes, a Java object can be locked down for exclusive use by a given thread using the synchronized keyword. By synchronizing on an object, a thread can acquire a lock on the object, preventing other threads from accessing it until the lock is released.

example of locking an object for exclusive use:

class LockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object lock = new Object();
        synchronized (lock) {
            System.out.println("Thread has acquired the lock.");
            // Perform exclusive operations on the object
        }
    }
}

What is static synchronization?

Static synchronization is a mechanism in Java that allows multiple threads to synchronize on a class-level lock. When a method is declared as synchronized and static, it locks the class object instead of the instance object. This ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized static method at a time.

example of static synchronization:

class StaticSynchronizationExample {
    public static synchronized void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static synchronized method is running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> staticMethod());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> staticMethod());
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}

How to detect a deadlock condition? How can it be avoided?

A deadlock condition can be detected by analyzing the thread dump or using tools like jstack or jvisualvm. To avoid a deadlock, follow these best practices:

Avoid nested locks: Try to acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent circular dependencies.
Use a timeout: Use a timeout mechanism to prevent threads from waiting indefinitely.
Use a single lock: Use a single lock to synchronize access to shared resources.
Use higher-level concurrency constructs: Use higher-level concurrency constructs like ExecutorService and CompletableFuture to manage threads and tasks.

example of detecting a deadlock condition:

class DeadlockDetectionExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task1());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task2());
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class Task1 implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock1.");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println("Task1 waiting for lock2.");
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Task1 acquired lock2.");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    static class Task2 implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock2.");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println("Task2 waiting for lock1.");
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Task2 acquired lock1.");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

What is the purpose of the java.util.concurrent package in Java?

The java.util.concurrent package in Java provides a set of high-level concurrency utilities that make it easier to write concurrent programs. It includes classes and interfaces for managing threads, tasks, and synchronization, as well as utilities for handling concurrent collections, locks, and executors.

What is Thread Scheduler in java?

Thread Scheduler in Java is a part of the JVM that decides which thread should run next. It is responsible for managing the execution of threads and determining the order in which threads are executed. The thread scheduler uses various scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which threads are executed.

example of Thread Scheduler in java:

class ThreadSchedulerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task("Task 1"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task("Task 2"));
        thread1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        thread2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private String name;

        public Task(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(name + " - " + i);
            }
        }
    }
}

What is the purpose of the java.util.concurrent.locks package in Java?

The java.util.concurrent.locks package in Java provides a set of lock implementations that can be used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. It includes classes like ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, and Condition, which provide more flexibility and control over synchronization than the synchronized keyword.

 Does each thread have its stack in multithreaded programming?

Yes, each thread in a multithreaded program has its own stack. The stack is used to store the method call stack, local variables, and other thread-specific data. Each thread has its own stack memory, which is separate from the stack memory of other threads.

example of each thread having its own stack:

class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task("Task 1"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task("Task 2"));
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private String name;

        public Task(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(name + " - Thread ID: " + Thread.currentThread().getId());
        }
    }
}


How is the safety of a thread achieved?

If a method or class object can be used by multiple threads at a time without any race condition, then the class is thread-safe. Thread safety is used to make a program safe to use in multithreaded programming. It can be achieved by the following ways:

Synchronization
Using Volatile keyword
Using a lock based mechanism
Use of atomic wrapper classes
