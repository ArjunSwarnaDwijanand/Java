How does a spring application get started?
A Spring application gets started by calling the main() method with @SpringBootApplication annotation in the SpringApplication class. This method takes a SpringApplicationBuilder object as a parameter, which is used to configure the application.

Once the SpringApplication object is created, the run() method is called.
Once the application context is initialized, the run() method starts the applicationâ€™s embedded web server.

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication
{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
  }
}

1. Build the Application: Build the Spring Boot application using the build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to generate the executable JAR file or WAR file for deployment.

2. Configure the Application: Configure the application properties, server settings, and deployment options in the application.properties or application.yml file to specify the server port, context path, and other deployment settings.

3. Deploy to the Server: Copy the generated JAR file or WAR file to the target server where the application will be deployed, and start the server to run the Spring Boot application.

4. Configure the Server: Configure the server settings, environment variables, and server-specific configurations on the target server to ensure that the Spring Boot application runs correctly and is accessible to users.

5. Monitor the Application: Monitor the deployed application, check the server logs, monitor the application performance, and troubleshoot any issues or errors that may arise during deployment and runtime.

Overall, deploying a Spring Boot application to a different server involves building the application, configuring the application properties, deploying the application to the server, configuring the server settings, and monitoring the application to ensure that it runs correctly and is accessible to users.

example of deploying a Spring Boot application to a different server:

1. Build the Application:
mvn clean package

2. Configure the Application:
# application.properties
server.port=8080
server.servlet.context-path=/myapp

3. Deploy to the Server:
Copy the target/myapp.jar file to the target server.

4. Configure the Server:
Start the server and configure the server settings, environment variables, and server-specific configurations.

5. Monitor the Application:
Monitor the application logs, check the server status, and troubleshoot any issues or errors during deployment and runtime.

@Primary annotation in Spring Boot?

The @Primary annotation in Spring Boot is used to indicate the primary bean to be used when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context. The @Primary annotation marks a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple beans of the same type are available, allowing developers to specify the default bean to be injected when multiple beans are present.

The main purpose of the @Primary annotation is to:

1. Define Primary Bean: The @Primary annotation defines a primary bean to be used when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context, allowing developers to specify the default bean to be injected when autowiring dependencies.

2. Resolve Ambiguity: The @Primary annotation resolves ambiguity and conflicts when multiple beans of the same type are available for autowiring, ensuring that the primary bean is selected and injected into the dependent components.

3. Default Bean: The @Primary annotation marks a bean as the default candidate for autowiring, allowing developers to specify the primary bean to be used when multiple beans are present, reducing the need for manual bean wiring and configuration.

4. Autowiring: The @Primary annotation supports autowiring by indicating the primary bean to be injected into the dependent components when multiple beans of the same type are available, ensuring that the primary bean is selected and used for autowiring.


example of @Primary annotation in Spring Boot:

@Component
@Primary
public class PrimaryService implements MyService {

    @Override
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Primary Service";
    }
}

@Component
public class SecondaryService implements MyService {

    @Override
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Secondary Service";
    }
}

@Service
public class MyServiceConsumer {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    public String useService() {
        return myService.getMessage();
    }
}

In this example, the PrimaryService class is marked with the @Primary annotation to indicate that it is the primary bean to be used when autowiring the MyService interface, ensuring that the PrimaryService bean is injected into the MyServiceConsumer class as the default bean.

What is the purpose of @Qualifier annotation in Spring Boot?

The @Qualifier annotation in Spring Boot is used to specify the name or value of the bean to be injected when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context. The @Qualifier annotation allows developers to specify the specific bean to be injected by name or value when autowiring dependencies with the @Autowired annotation.

The main purpose of the @Qualifier annotation is to:

1. Specify Bean Name: The @Qualifier annotation specifies the name or value of the bean to be injected when multiple beans of the same type are available for autowiring, allowing developers to specify the specific bean to be injected by name.

2. Resolve Ambiguity: The @Qualifier annotation resolves ambiguity and conflicts when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context, ensuring that the specific bean is selected and injected into the dependent components.

3. Custom Bean Selection: The @Qualifier annotation allows developers to define custom bean selection criteria based on the bean name or value, ensuring that the specific bean is selected and used for autowiring dependencies.

4. Autowiring: The @Qualifier annotation supports autowiring by specifying the specific bean to be injected into the dependent components when multiple beans of the same type are available, ensuring that the qualified bean is selected and used for autowiring.


example of @Qualifier annotation in Spring Boot:

@Component("primaryService")
public class PrimaryService implements MyService {

    @Override
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Primary Service";
    }
}

@Component("secondaryService")
public class SecondaryService implements MyService {

    @Override
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Secondary Service";
    }
}

@Service
public class MyServiceConsumer {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("primaryService")
    private MyService myService;

    public String useService() {
        return myService.getMessage();
    }
}

In this example, the @Qualifier("primaryService") annotation is used to specify the name of the bean ("primaryService") to be injected into the MyServiceConsumer class when autowiring the MyService interface, ensuring that the PrimaryService bean is selected and injected as the qualified bean.

What is the purpose of @Lazy annotation in Spring Boot?

The @Lazy annotation in Spring Boot is used to indicate that a bean should be lazily initialized and created only when it is first accessed or requested by a dependent component. The @Lazy annotation allows developers to delay the initialization of beans and improve the application startup time by deferring the creation of beans until they are needed.

The main purpose of the @Lazy annotation is to:

1. Lazy Initialization: The @Lazy annotation enables lazy initialization of beans by deferring the creation of beans until they are first accessed or requested by a dependent component, reducing the startup time and memory usage of the application.

2. Improve Performance: The @Lazy annotation improves the performance of the application by delaying the creation of beans and reducing the number of beans that are eagerly initialized during the application startup, optimizing the memory usage and resource consumption of the application.

3. Reduce Startup Time: The @Lazy annotation reduces the startup time of the application by initializing beans on-demand and avoiding the eager creation of all beans at startup, allowing developers to optimize the application startup process and improve the application performance.

4. Optimize Resource Usage: The @Lazy annotation optimizes the resource usage of the application by creating beans only when they are needed, reducing the memory footprint and resource consumption of the application during runtime.


example of @Lazy annotation in Spring Boot:

@Component
@Lazy
public class LazyService {

    public LazyService() {
        System.out.println("LazyService initialized");
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return "Lazy Service";
    }
}

@Service
public class LazyServiceConsumer {

    @Autowired
    @Lazy
    private LazyService lazyService;

    public String useService() {
        return lazyService.getMessage();
    }
}

In this example, the LazyService class is marked with the @Lazy annotation to indicate that it should be lazily initialized and created only when it is first accessed by the LazyServiceConsumer class, delaying the creation of the LazyService bean until it is needed.

What is a Swagger in Spring Boot?

Swagger is an open-source framework that provides tools for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs in Spring Boot applications. Swagger allows developers to define API specifications, generate API documentation, and interact with APIs using a user-friendly interface, making it easier to design, test, and document RESTful services in Spring Boot applications.

The main features of Swagger in Spring Boot include:

1. API Documentation: Swagger generates interactive API documentation for Spring Boot applications, allowing developers to define API specifications, endpoints, request/response formats, and parameters in a structured and readable way.

2. API Testing: Swagger provides a user-friendly interface for testing and interacting with RESTful APIs, allowing developers to send requests, view responses, and test API endpoints using the Swagger UI or Swagger Editor.

3. Code Generation: Swagger supports code generation for client libraries, server stubs, and API clients in various programming languages, allowing developers to generate code snippets, client libraries, and server stubs based on the API specifications defined in Swagger.

4. API Security: Swagger supports API security features such as authentication, authorization, and access control, allowing developers to secure and protect the APIs using OAuth, JWT, and other security mechanisms in Spring Boot applications.

5. Integration: Swagger integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot applications using the springfox-swagger2 and springfox-swagger-ui dependencies, providing support for API documentation, testing, and code generation in Spring Boot projects.

Overall, Swagger is a powerful framework for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs in Spring Boot applications, providing features such as API documentation, testing, code generation, security, and integration with Spring Boot projects.

example of using Swagger in a Spring Boot application:

@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

    @Bean
    public Docket api() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("org.example.controller"))
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build();
    }
}

In this example, the SwaggerConfig class is used to configure Swagger in a Spring Boot application by enabling Swagger 2 support, defining the API documentation settings, and specifying the base package for scanning the controller classes to generate the API documentation.
