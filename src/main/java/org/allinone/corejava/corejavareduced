What is Java ?

Java is object oriented programming language.
It is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
It was first released in 1995. Java is a platform-independent language.
It is used to develop various applications like web applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, games, etc.
Java is widely used in the software industry.

What is the difference between JVM, JRE, JDK?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.

JVM = Class Loader + Byte Code Verifier + Interpreter + JIT Compiler

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides the Java runtime environment and libraries required to run Java applications.
JRE = JVM + Java Packages Classes(like util, math, lang, awt, swing etc)

JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that provides the tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications.
JDK = JRE + Development Tools (like compiler, debugger, etc)

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent).

What is JIT?

JIT stands for Just-In-Time compilation. It is used by the JVM to improve the performance of Java programs.
JIT compiles the bytecode into native machine code at runtime, which can be executed directly by the CPU.



What is ClassLoader in Java?

ClassLoader is a subsystem of JVM that is used to load classes and interfaces. It is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
ClassLoader is responsible for loading Java classes during runtime dynamically to the JVM.

Types of ClassLoader in Java:

Bootstrap ClassLoader: It is the parent of all class loaders and loads classes from the bootstrap classpath.
Extension ClassLoader: It is the child of the Bootstrap ClassLoader and loads classes from the extension classpath.
System/Application ClassLoader: It is the child of the Extension ClassLoader and loads classes from the application classpath.
Custom ClassLoader: It is a user-defined class loader that loads classes from a custom location.
