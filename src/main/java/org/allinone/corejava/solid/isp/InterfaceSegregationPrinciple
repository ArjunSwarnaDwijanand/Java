InterfaceSegregationPrinciple

The principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.
This principle is about the design of interfaces.
It is about how to split a big interface into smaller interfaces so that a client does not have to implement methods it does not use.

The goal of the interface segregation principle is similar to the single responsibility principle.
